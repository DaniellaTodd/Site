    <p><i>Altitude Above Hygiene</i> is a digital tract surfacing nightlife pasts from waste and architectural incontinence.
      Through speculating transmissions with nonhuman/inhuman matter, the tract seeks to attune to the slippery grammar of effluence, remembering <i>with</i> and <i>from</i> the imagined (and residual) waste of ecstatic encounters.
      Abstracted field recordings of architectural spillage, gathered from sites that held Black queer nightlife in London, are linked by digestive pipage co-visioned and shaped by multidisciplinary new:media artist <a href="https://www.gwenba.com/">GWENBA</a>,
      to mock up a system of ingestion, expulsion and collaboration. <i>Altitude Above Hygiene</i> is a testing ground that seeks to ask what waste remembers? What (muffled) positionalities can detritus and spectral interference
      offer up to unfix the formalities of preservation? How can thinking through waste honour the desanitised nature of erotic expression?</p>
